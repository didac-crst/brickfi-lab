git clone <repository-url>
cd housing-strategy-dashboard

# Complete setup
make setup
```

### 2. Daily Development
```bash
# Start development environment
make dev

# In another terminal, check logs if needed
make logs

# Stop when done
make down
```

### 3. Testing Changes
```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make lint
make format

# Security scan
make security-scan
```

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Build production images

## Environment Configuration

### Using Environment Variables
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your specific configuration:
   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

### Key Environment Variables
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Frontend API URL
- `BACKEND_PORT`: Backend server port
- `FRONTEND_PORT`: Frontend server port
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: Allowed CORS origins

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Docker Not Running
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker info

# Start Docker Desktop or Docker daemon
# Then retry your make command
```

#### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :8000

# Stop conflicting services or change ports in .env
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Fix Docker permissions (Linux/Mac)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

#### Clean Start
```bash
# Complete cleanup and restart
make clean-all
make setup
```

### Getting Help
```bash
# Show all available commands
make help

# Check container status
make status

# View logs for debugging
make logs
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Docker Registry
```bash
# Deploy with custom registry
./scripts/deploy.sh production your-registry.com v1.2.3
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests
make perf-test
```

### Backup and Restore
```bash
# Create backup
make backup

# Restore from backup (manual process)
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The Makefile is designed to work well with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Build and Test
  run: |
    make install
    make test
    make lint
    make build

- name: Deploy
  run: make deploy
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `make help`** to see available commands
2. **Use `make setup`** for first-time setup
3. **Use `make dev`** for development work
4. **Use `make clean`** when things go wrong
5. **Use `make health`** to verify deployments
6. **Use scripts for production deployments**

## Contributing

When adding new Makefile targets:
1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Add help text with `## Description`
3. Test the command thoroughly
4. Update this guide if needed
